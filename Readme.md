**Operator Overloading:**
I have been working on this simple code in order to overload '<<' operator to print my object. I
have not had any luck with it so far. After some time I was able to solve the problem and now the
code is fully functional.

**Code Content**
The code has 'person' class with 'fullName','age', and 'salary' data members. It also has '+' 
operator overloaded and the 'getSalery' member function.
